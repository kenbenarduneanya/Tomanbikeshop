## Insights Deep Dive & Recommendation
#### Conservative Increase:
Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market's response without risking a significant loss of customers.

#### Price Setting:
* If the price in 2022 was was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the price about $5.49.
* A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.

#### Recommended Strategy:
   * Market Analysis: Conduct further market research to understand current market conditions, competitive changes, and the overall economic environment.
   * Segmented Pricing Strategy: Consider different pricing for casual and premium customers, as they may have different price sensitivities.
   * Monitor and Adjust: Implement the new prices but be ready to adjust them based on feedback and sales data. Monitoring closely will allow you to fine tune your pricing stategy without committing fully to a price that might turn out too high.
